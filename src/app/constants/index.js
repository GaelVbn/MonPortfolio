export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hello! My name is Gael, and I am a passionate 26-year-old web and mobile developer. From a young age, I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can transform our daily lives.

My journey into development began recently with the program at La Capsule. This BootCamp, specialized in full-stack web and mobile application development, allowed me to affirm my passion for web and mobile development from my very first lines of code. During this training, I learned to master JavaScript as well as libraries such as React and React Native.

At the end of my training, I had the opportunity to participate in a mobile application project focused on ecology and our environmental impact. This project allowed me to hone my skills in both back-end and front-end development.

My goal is to continue evolving as a developer, learning new technologies, and working on innovative projects. I am always looking for new opportunities and challenges to tackle. 

Feel free to contact me if you have interesting projects or collaborations in mind. Thank you for taking the time to read my story!`;
